# Research Experience
## Thesis on Neural Mechanism of Children Emotion Socialisation
08/2023 - Present

+ Investigated how parental emotion socialization practices (e.g.,
emotional expression, regulation support, and coaching) impact
preschoolers’ emotional development, focusing on parent-child brain
synchronization and emotional cognitive abilities.
+ Examined the differing influences of fathers and mothers, alongside
variations in parental traits, parenting styles, and attachment dynamics,
on children’s emotional and neural outcomes.
+ Utilized fNIRS techniques, including hyperscanning and single-participant setups, to study the neural basis of parent-child interactions
and children’s emotion recognition and regulation.

## Theory of Mind in Autism vs. Typically Developing Children
08/2023 - 12/2023

+ Sythesized fMRI studies examined task-related brain functional
connectivity patterns associated with Theory of Mind in
children with autism and typically developing children.
+ Contributed to a fMRI meta-analysis currently under review.

## Intervention Study on Cantonese Phonetics and Morphological Awareness
06/2023 - 12/2023

+ Investigated how Cantonese phonetics instruction influences
morphological awareness in young children.
+ Contributed to a manuscript under submission.

## Social Interactions and Children Learning Process
10/2020 - 12/2022

+ Led empirical studies using fNIRS hyperscanning to explore the neurological impact of parental feedback on the cognitive processes of children aged 6-8 during challenging tasks.
+ Led research investigating the effects of various teaching
strategies on STEM learning processes in 6-8-year-old children
using fNIRS hyperscanning.

## Family Environment and Child Well-being
03/2023 - 12/2023
+ Led the design and conducted cross-sectional studies with
elementary school students to examine how family environment
factors, including parenting beliefs, influence children’s mental
health outcomes, such as smartphone addiction and overall
emotional well-being.
+ Contributed to two manuscripts currently under review.
## Emotion Words Studies
08/2019 - 01/2020

+ Collected and organized ERP data for a study investigating how
university students process emotional images primed by emotion
words.

# Skills

+ Data Analysis and Programming:
Proficient in SPSS, R, and
MATLAB for statistical modeling,
data management, and advanced
processing. Experienced in
structural equation modeling
(SEM), moderation and mediation
analyses, meta-analyses, and
meta-analytic structural equation
modeling (MASEM).

+ Cognitive Neuroscience and
Experimental Design: Skilled in
designing and conducting cross-sectional and longitudinal studies
that integrate behavioral
assessments with cognitive
neuroscience methodologies,
including EEG, ERP, and fNIRS;
currently developing proficiency
in fMRI.
