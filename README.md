# Research Experience
## Thesis Research
12/2023 - Present

Investigates how parental emotion socialization practices (e.g., emotional expression, regulation support, and coaching) influence children’s emotional socialization processes (e.g., parent-child brain synchronization) and outcomes (e.g., emotional cognitive abilities).
Explores the moderating effects of parental personality traits, parenting styles, and parent-child attachment differences on these processes.
Utilizes fNIRS techniques, including hyperscanning to study neural synchronization during parent-child emotional interactions and single-participant setups to examine children’s emotional cognitive abilities, focusing on neural correlates of emotion recognition and regulation.

## Functional Connectivity in Autism vs. Typically Developing Children
08/2023 - 12/2023

Examined task-related brain functional connectivity patterns associated with Theory of Mind (ToM) in children with autism and typically developing children.
Applied fNIRS and meta-analytic methods to explore neurological underpinnings of social cognition.
Contributed to a meta-analysis currently under review.

## Behavioral Study on Cantonese Phonetics and Morphological Awareness
06/2023 - 12/2023

Investigated how Cantonese phonetics instruction influences morphological awareness in young children.
Designed experiments to measure phonetic learning outcomes, contributing to a manuscript under submission.

## Parental Feedback and Emotional Outcomes
10/2020 - 12/2022

Designed and conducted empirical studies using fNIRS hyperscanning to explore the neurological impact of parental feedback on children's emotional outcomes.

## Pedagogical Approaches in STEM Learning
10/2020 - 12/2022

Explored the impact of various teaching strategies on children’s STEM learning processes using fNIRS hyperscanning.

## Emotion Word Studies
08/2019 - 01/2020

Conducted ERP data collection for research on emotion words under the Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, University of Macau.

## Parental Emotion Socialization and Child Well-being
03/2023 - 12/2023

Conducted cross-sectional studies to investigate how parental emotion socialization influences children’s emotional and cognitive development.
Contributed to two manuscripts currently under review, focusing on parent-child interactions and emotional outcomes.

## Longitudinal Study on Preschool Program Quality
05/2018 - 09/2018

Utilized SPSS to analyze longitudinal data on preschool quality and its effects on children’s learning outcomes.
Contributed to the design of evaluation tools for high-quality preschool programs.
